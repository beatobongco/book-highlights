Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl
"He who has a Why to live for can bear almost any How." - Friedrich Nietzsche
Frankl shares his experience being a prisoner in a concentration camp. He notes that the ones who survived were not the strongest, but had found the strongest meaning in their existence and suffering.
