How To Win Friends And Influence People by Dale Carnegie
The book that changed my life. It also got me into reading non-fiction. This is a book everyone should read.
This is a book everyone should read. Stop thinking about yourself all the time. Be interested in others and empathize with them. There's always something to learn from them. Be nice and be sincere.
