# book-highlights
Styled exports of books I read on Kindle https://beatobongco.com/book-highlights/

## Setup

This is a temporary setup. I plan to generalize this (perhaps on a separate repo) so others can use it.
For now, however, these instructions will suffice.

0. Clone this repo
1. Remove contents of `raw_notes` and `book` folders
1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Dump your Kindle notes in the `raw_notes` folder. See [file format](#file-format)
3. Run `python generate_pages.py`
4. Push
5. Make your repo available as a github page and you're done!

## File format

The filename becomes the HTML filename and thus the URL.

e.g. `a-mind-at-play` -> (run script) -> `a-mind-at-play.html` -> on github pages this can be accessed as `<your URL>/a-mind-at-play`

The following format is subject to change, but for now files are parsed by line number.

```
Line 1: Title
Line 2: Summary (appears after title)
Line 3: Short summary (appears as meta description and opengraph description)
Line 4+: The actual output of your Kindle Reader export
```

## Index

For now, you'll have to manually design and generate your index page. However, in future iterations this will be autogenerated by script also.

## Theming

Just change up `book.css` and you're good to go!

## Integration with search

You can add the url argument `?highlight=[YOUR QUERY]` to highlight the first instance of that query and scroll to it.
