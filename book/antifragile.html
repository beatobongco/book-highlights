Prologue

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.
Highlight (yellow) - Page 5
anything that has more upside than downside from random events (or certain shocks) is antifragile; the reverse is fragile.
Highlight (yellow) - Page 6
Thou shalt not have antifragility at the expense of the fragility of others.
Highlight (yellow) - Page 8
Given the unattainability of perfect robustness, we need a mechanism by which the system regenerates itself continuously by using, rather than suffering from, random events, unpredictable shocks, stressors, and volatility.
Note - Page 8
Is antifragility possible for artificial intelligence systems? A machine that learns to find meaning from random events to decrease its cost function somehow. That begs the question of the cost function, it has to either be more fluid or more abstract for this to happen.

Heuristics are simplified rules of thumb that make things simple and easy to implement. But their main advantage is that the user knows that they are not perfect, just expedient, and is therefore less fooled by their powers. They become dangerous when we forget that.
Highlight (yellow) - Page 11
I suddenly realized one day that fragility— which had been lacking a technical definition— could be expressed as what does not like volatility, and that what does not like volatility does not like randomness, uncertainty, disorder, errors, stressors, etc.
Highlight (yellow) - Page 12
antifragility flows— sort of— from this explicit definition of fragility. It likes volatility et al. It also likes time. And there is a powerful and helpful link to nonlinearity: everything nonlinear in response is either fragile or antifragile to a certain source of randomness.

If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud. Just as being nice to the arrogant is no better than being arrogant toward the nice, being accommodating toward anyone committing a nefarious action condones it.

If you want to become antifragile, put yourself in the situation “loves mistakes”— to the right of “hates mistakes”— by making these numerous and small in harm. We will call this process and approach the “barbell” strategy.
Book I: The Antifragile: An Introduction
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 1. Between Damocles and Hydra > Page 34
Hydra, in Greek mythology, is a serpent- like creature that dwells in the lake of Lerna, near Argos, and has numerous heads. Each time one is cut off, two grow back. So harm is what it likes. Hydra represents antifragility.

post- traumatic growth, the opposite of post- traumatic stress syndrome, by which people harmed by past events surpass themselves.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 41
How do you innovate? First, try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal, trouble. I hold— it is beyond speculation, rather a conviction— that innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity, in ways that go far beyond the satisfaction of such necessity (from the unintended side effects of, say, an initial invention or attempt at invention).
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 42
Latin saying that sophistication is born out of hunger (artificia docuit fames). The idea pervades classical literature: in Ovid, difficulty is what wakes up the genius (ingenium mala saepe movent), which translates in Brooklyn English into “When life gives you a lemon…”
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 42
The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 42
innovation comes from bureaucratic funding, through planning, or by putting people through a Harvard Business School class by one Highly Decorated Professor of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (who never innovated anything) or hiring a consultant (who never innovated anything). This is a fallacy— note for now the disproportionate contribution of uneducated technicians and entrepreneurs to various technological leaps, from the Industrial Revolution to the emergence of Silicon Valley, and you will see what I mean.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 42
The record shows that, for society, the richer we become, the harder it gets to live within our means. Abundance is harder for us to handle than scarcity.
Note - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 43
Maybe this can be offset by self x paternalism, where a dynamic percent of savings are automatically deducted and put into stocks / savings account. This can create artificial scarcity but with increased security. Then maybe the saved up funds can be used to kick-start your own ventures.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 43
Undercompensation from the absence of a stressor, inverse hormesis, absence of challenge, degrades the best of the best.
Note - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 43
So this just means to always do hard things. Challenge yourself and get out of comfort zone. If you don't feel stressed, find ways to create commitments which will force that stress.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 43
This mechanism of overcompensation hides in the most unlikely places. If tired after an intercontinental flight, go to the gym for some exertion instead of resting.

I learned that the noise produced by the person is inverse to the pecking order: as with mafia dons, the most powerful traders were the least audible.

One should have enough self- control to make the audience work hard to listen, which causes them to switch into intellectual overdrive.
Note - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 43
Not sure about this. But perhaps temper your enthusiasm while speaking. Be passionate but controlled. Speak with better pause and cadence.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 44
there is empirical evidence of the effect of “disfluency.” Mental effort moves us into higher gear, activating more vigorous and more analytical brain machinery.

Layers of redundancy are the central risk management property of natural systems.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 44
we have a historical track record of engaging in debt, which is the opposite of redundancy (fifty thousand in extra cash in the bank or, better, under the mattress, is redundancy; owing the bank an equivalent amount, that is, debt, is the opposite of redundancy). Redundancy is ambiguous because it seems like a waste if nothing unusual happens. Except that something unusual happens— usually.

Lucretius problem, after the Latin poetic philosopher who wrote that the fool believes that the tallest mountain in the world will be equal to the tallest one he has observed.

“Repeated punishment, while it crushes the hatred of a few, stirs the hatred of all… just as trees that have been trimmed throw out again countless branches.”

the more energy you put into trying to control your ideas and what you think about, the more your ideas end up controlling you.
Note - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 49
That's why meditation is the answer. Not repressing your thoughts but allowing yourself to think/feel them and letting them pass without judgment.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 49
Information is antifragile; it feeds more on attempts to harm it than it does on efforts to promote it. For instance, many wreck their reputations merely by trying to defend them.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 52
With few exceptions, those who dress outrageously are robust or even antifragile in reputation; those clean- shaven types who dress in suits and ties are fragile to information about them.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 2. Overcompensation and Overreaction Everywhere > Page 53
Just as in matters of seduction, people lend the most to those who need them the least.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 4. What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger > Page 65
The fragility of every startup is necessary for the economy to be antifragile, and that’s what makes, among other things, entrepreneurship work: the fragility of individual entrepreneurs and their necessarily high failure rate.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 4. What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger > Page 71
When you want deviations, and you don’t care about the possible dispersion of outcomes that the future can bring, since most will be helpful, you are antifragile. Further, the random element in trial and error is not quite random, if it is carried out rationally, using error as a source of information. If every trial provides you with information about what does not work, you start zooming in on a solution— so every attempt becomes more valuable, more like an expense than an error. And of course you make discoveries along the way.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 4. What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger > Page 74
my characterization of a loser is someone who, after making a mistake, doesn’t introspect, doesn’t exploit it, feels embarrassed and defensive rather than enriched with a new piece of information, and tries to explain why he made the mistake rather than moving on. These types often consider themselves the “victims” of some large plot, a bad boss, or bad weather.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 4. What Kills Me Makes Others Stronger > Page 74
He who has never sinned is less reliable than he who has only sinned once. And someone who has made plenty of errors— though never the same error more than once— is more reliable than someone who has never made any.

National Entrepreneur Day, with the following message: Most of you will fail, disrespected, impoverished, but we are grateful for the risks you are taking and the sacrifices you are making for the sake of the economic growth of the planet and pulling others out of poverty. You are at the source of our antifragility. Our nation thanks you.
Book II: Modernity and the Denial of Antifragility
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 5. The Souk and the Office Building > Page 84
This is the central illusion in life: that randomness is risky, that it is a bad thing— and that eliminating randomness is done by eliminating randomness.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 5. The Souk and the Office Building > Page 88
The way people handle local affairs is vastly different from the way they handle large, abstract public expenditures: we have traditionally lived in small units and tribes and managed rather well in small units.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 5. The Souk and the Office Building > Page 89
“Stalin could not have existed in a municipality.”
Note - Chapter 5. The Souk and the Office Building > Page 89
Of course, this is a negative example but does this hold true for greatness also? Can greatness be accomplished in a municipality? Perhaps not, and that's why people correctly dream to move to the big city.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 5. The Souk and the Office Building > Page 89
The problem is that by creating bureaucracies, we put civil servants in a position to make decisions based on abstract and theoretical matters, with the illusion that they will be making them in a rational, accountable way.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 6. Tell Them I Love (Some) Randomness > Page 102
The idea of injecting random noise into a system to improve its functioning has been applied across fields. By a mechanism called stochastic resonance, adding random noise to the background makes you hear the sounds (say, music) with more accuracy.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 114
People with an engineering- oriented mind will tend to look at everything around as an engineering problem. This is a very good thing in engineering, but when dealing with cats, it is a much better idea to hire veterinarians than circuits engineers— or even better, let your animal heal by itself.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 123
Since procrastination is a message from our natural willpower via low motivation, the cure is changing the environment, or one’s profession, by selecting one in which one does not have to fight one’s impulses.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 123
Actually I select the writing of the passages of this book by means of procrastination. If I defer writing a section, it must be eliminated. This is simple ethics: Why should I try to fool people by writing about a subject for which I feel no natural drive?
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 126
The more frequently you look at data, the more noise you are disproportionally likely to get
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 126
anyone who listens to news (except when very, very significant events take place) is one step below sucker.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 7. Naive Intervention > Page 127
The best solution is to only look at very large changes in data or conditions, never at small ones. Just as we are not likely to mistake a bear for a stone (but likely to mistake a stone for a bear), it is almost impossible for someone rational, with a clear, uninfected mind, someone who is not drowning in data, to mistake a vital signal, one that matters for his survival, for noise— unless he is overanxious, oversensitive, and neurotic, hence distracted and confused by other messages. Significant signals have a way to reach you.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 8. Prediction as a Child of Modernity > Page 135
There are ample empirical findings to the effect that providing someone with a random numerical forecast increases his risk taking, even if the person knows the projections are random.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 8. Prediction as a Child of Modernity > Page 140
What are the Quadrants? Combining exposures and types of randomness we get four combinations: Mediocristan randomness, low exposure to extreme events (First Quadrant); Mediocristan randomness, high exposure to extreme events (Second Quadrant); Extremistan randomness, low exposure to extreme events (Third Quadrant); Extremistan randomness, high exposure to extreme events (Fourth Quadrant). The first three quadrants are ones in which knowledge or lack of it bring inconsequential errors. “Robustification” is the modification of exposures to make a switch from the fourth to the third quadrant.
Book III: A Nonpredictive View of the World
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 9. Fat Tony and the Fragilistas > Page 147
wealth was nonlinear. Beyond some level it forces people into endless complications of their lives, creating worries about whether the housekeeper in one of the country houses is scamming them while doing a poor job and similar headaches that multiply with money.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 10. Seneca’s Upside and Downside > Page 152
wisdom in decision making is vastly more important— not just practically, but philosophically— than knowledge.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 10. Seneca’s Upside and Downside > Page 152
To become a successful philosopher king, it is much better to start as a king than as a philosopher,
Note - Chapter 10. Seneca’s Upside and Downside > Page 152
This means practice first, then theory. So fool around with libraries and APIs first and then study formally to augment your practice.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 10. Seneca’s Upside and Downside > Page 153
the key phrase reverberating in Seneca’s oeuvre is nihil perditi, “I lost nothing,” after an adverse event.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 10. Seneca’s Upside and Downside > Page 154
Success brings an asymmetry: you now have a lot more to lose than to gain. You are hence fragile.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 160
if something is fragile, its risk of breaking makes anything you do to improve it or make it “efficient” inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 161
antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia— clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black Swans, take care of itself. We saw Seneca’s asymmetry: more upside than downside can come simply from the reduction of extreme downside (emotional harm) rather than improving things in the middle.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 164
professions can be serial: something very safe, then something speculative.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 165
This is what Seneca elected to do: he initially had a very active, adventurous life, followed by a philosophical withdrawal to write and meditate, rather than a “middle” combination of both. Many of the “doers” turned “thinkers” like Montaigne have done a serial barbell: pure action, then pure reflection.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 165
if I have to work, I find it preferable (and less painful) to work intensely for very short hours, then do nothing for the rest of the time (assuming doing nothing is really doing nothing), until I recover completely and look forward to a repetition, rather than being subjected to the tedium of Japanese style low- intensity interminable office hours with sleep deprivation.
Note - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 165
So short periods of deep work and scheduled leisure or random periods. This can probably be worked into a hyperproductive morning schedule, and then afternoon and evenings left for experiencing life and randomness which augments the deep work period. The key, I think, is consistency of the deep work period. It is possible to get a lot done in only a few hours should attention be 100% there.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 165
Georges Simenon, one of the most prolific writers of the twentieth century, only wrote sixty days a year, with three hundred days spent “doing nothing.” He published more than two hundred novels.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 11. Never Marry the Rock Star > Page 166
More barbells. Do crazy things (break furniture once in a while), like the Greeks during the later stages of a drinking symposium, and stay “rational” in larger decisions. Trashy gossip magazines and classics or sophisticated works; never middlebrow stuff. Talk to either undergraduate students, cab drivers, and gardeners or the highest caliber scholars; never to middling- but- career- conscious academics. If you dislike someone, leave him alone or eliminate him; don’t attack him verbally. 2

The rational flâneur is someone who, unlike a tourist, makes a decision at every step to revise his schedule, so he can imbibe things based on new information, what Nero was trying to practice in his travels, often guided by his sense of smell. The flâneur is not a prisoner of a plan. Tourism, actual or figurative, is imbued with the teleological illusion; it assumes completeness of vision and gets one locked into a hard- to- revise program, while the flâneur continuously— and, what is crucial, rationally— modifies his targets as he acquires information.
Highlight (yellow) - Do You Really Know Where You Are Going? > Page 170
Now a warning: the opportunism of the flâneur is great in life and business— but not in personal life and matters that involve others. The opposite of opportunism in human relations is loyalty, a noble sentiment— but one that needs to be invested in the right places, that is, in human relations and moral commitments.
Highlight (yellow) - Do You Really Know Where You Are Going? > Page 172
Like Britain in the Industrial Revolution, America’s asset is, simply, risk taking and the use of optionality, this remarkable ability to engage in rational forms of trial and error, with no comparative shame in failing, starting again, and repeating failure. In modern Japan, by contrast, shame comes with failure, which causes people to hide risks under the rug, financial or nuclear, making small benefits while sitting on dynamite, an attitude that strangely contrasts with their traditional respect for fallen heroes and the so- called nobility of failure.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 12. Thales’ Sweet Grapes > Page 174
The worst side effect of wealth is the social associations it forces on its victims, as people with big houses tend to end up socializing with other people with big houses. Beyond a certain level of opulence and independence, gents tend to be less and less personable and their conversation less and less interesting.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 12. Thales’ Sweet Grapes > Page 176
The essayist Michel de Montaigne sees the Thales episode as a story of immunity to sour grapes: you need to know whether you do not like the pursuit of money and wealth because you genuinely do not like it, or because you are rationalizing your inability to be successful at it with the argument that wealth is not a good thing because it is bad for one’s digestive system or disturbing for one’s sleep or other such arguments.

Bricolage is a form of trial and error close to tweaking, trying to make do with what you’ve got by recycling pieces that would be otherwise wasted.

Steve Jobs at a famous speech: “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” He probably meant “Be crazy but retain the rationality of choosing the upper bound when you see it.”

In trial and error, the rationality consists in not rejecting something that is markedly better than what you had before.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 13. Lecturing Birds on How to Fly > Page 189
Just as great geniuses invent their predecessors, practical innovations create their theoretical ancestry.
Note - Chapter 13. Lecturing Birds on How to Fly > Page 189
Takeaway from the chapter so far: for a lot of innovations, the technology had been ripe for a long time already. It just took someone to put 2 and 2 together. So the deeper takeaway is: it's good to look at the inventions of the past and see if there are ways to tweak them and make them applicable in the current context.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 13. Lecturing Birds on How to Fly > Page 190
both governments and universities have done very, very little for innovation and discovery, precisely because, in addition to their blinding rationalism, they look for the complicated, the lurid, the newsworthy, the narrated, the scientistic, and the grandiose, rarely for the wheel on the suitcase. Simplicity, I realized, does not lead to laurels.

The Soviet- Harvard illusion (lecturing birds on flying and believing that the lecture is the cause of these wonderful skills) belongs to a class of causal illusions called epiphenomena. What are these illusions? When you spend time on the bridge of a ship or in the coxswain’s station with a large compass in front, you can easily develop the impression that the compass is directing the ship rather than merely reflecting its direction.

Serious empirical investigation (largely thanks to one Lant Pritchet, then a World Bank economist) shows no evidence that raising the general level of education raises income at the level of a country.

Education stabilizes the income of families across generations. A merchant makes money, then his children go to the Sorbonne, they become doctors and magistrates. The family retains wealth because the diplomas allow members to remain in the middle class long after the ancestral wealth is depleted. But these effects don’t count for countries.

Accordingly, wisdom you learn from your grandmother should be vastly superior (empirically, hence scientifically) to what you get from a class in business school (and, of course, considerably cheaper). My sadness is that we have been moving farther and farther away from grandmothers.

An extraordinary proportion of work came out of the rector, the English parish priest with no worries, erudition, a large or at least comfortable house, domestic help, a reliable supply of tea and scones with clotted cream, and an abundance of free time. And, of course, optionality.

The Industrial Revolution, for a refresher, came from “technologists building technology,” or what he calls “hobby science.” Take again the steam engine, the one artifact that more than anything else embodies the Industrial Revolution. As we saw, we had a blueprint of how to build it from Hero of Alexandria. Yet the theory didn’t interest anyone for about two millennia. So practice and rediscovery had to be the cause of the interest in Hero’s blueprint, not the other way around.

Postulate: a good innovation process would be to first define a problem deeply, form a hypothesis of how to solve, look at the gaps in your knowledge (what do I need to learn to solve the problem?), look for old greats who attempted to solve the problem, learn, build a prototype and iterate while learning on the fly.

Same as dad's argument to "keep your ear to the ground". Random thought: I wonder if before I was too obsessed with optionality and having that plus the tyranny of choice I was paralyzed.

Consequently, payoff from research should necessarily be linear to number of trials, not total funds involved in the trials. Since, as in Figure 7, the winner will have an explosive payoff, uncapped, the right approach requires a certain style of blind funding. It means the right policy would be what is called “one divided by n” or “1/ N” style, spreading attempts in as large a number of trials as possible: if you face n options, invest in all of them in equal amounts.

From Quora: The idea is to evaluate systems (any system—governments, investment ideas, lifestyle choices, scientific investigations, ecologies—anything) not by the probabilities of good or bad payoffs, but by whether the best case benefits are bigger or smaller than the worst case losses. If the losses are bigger, the system is fragile. If the payoffs are roughly equal, the system is robust. If the benefits are bigger, the system is antifragile. Picking up nickels in front of a steamroller is fragile. The best case benefit is $0.05, the worst case loss is getting flattened. Taking a short-cut to avoid traffic is robust. In the best case you save some time, in the worst case you lose some time. Striking up a conversation with an interesting looking stranger is antifragile. In the best case you could make a valuable connection or friend for life, in the worst case you’ll get brushed off or have a few minutes of boredom.

(i) Look for optionality; in fact, rank things according to optionality, (ii) preferably with open- ended, not closed- ended, payoffs; (iii) Do not invest in business plans but in people, so look for someone capable of changing six or seven times over his career, or more (an idea that is part of the modus operandi of the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen); one gets immunity from the backfit narratives of the business plan by investing in people. It is simply more robust to do so; (iv) Make sure you are barbelled, whatever that means in your business.

So the central tenet of the epistemology I advocate is as follows: we know a lot more what is wrong than what is right, or, phrased according to the fragile/ robust classification, negative knowledge (what is wrong, what does not work) is more robust to error than positive knowledge (what is right, what works). So knowledge grows by subtraction much more than by addition— given that what we know today might turn out to be wrong but what we know to be wrong cannot turn out to be right, at least not easily.

If I spot a black swan (not capitalized), I can be quite certain that the statement “all swans are white” is wrong. But even if I have never seen a black swan, I can never hold such a statement to be true.

Technothinkers tend to have an “engineering mind”— to put it less politely, they have autistic tendencies. While they don’t usually wear ties, these types tend, of course, to exhibit all the textbook characteristics of nerdiness— mostly lack of charm, interest in objects instead of persons, causing them to neglect their looks. They love precision at the expense of applicability. And they typically share an absence of literary culture.
Highlight (yellow) - Chapter 20. Time and Fragility > Page 314
This absence of literary culture is actually a marker of future blindness because it is usually accompanied by a denigration of history, a byproduct of unconditional neomania. Outside of the niche and isolated genre of science fiction, literature is about the past. We do not learn physics or biology from medieval textbooks, but we still read Homer, Plato, or the very modern Shakespeare. We cannot talk about sculpture without knowledge of the works of Phidias, Michelangelo, or the great Canova. These are in the past, not in the future. Just by setting foot into a museum, the aesthetically minded person is connecting with the elders. Whether overtly or not, he will tend to acquire and respect historical knowledge, even if it is to reject it. And the past— properly handled, as we will see in the next section— is a much better teacher about the properties of the future than the present. To understand the future, you do not need technoautistic jargon, obsession with “killer apps,” these sort of things. You just need the following: some respect for the past, some curiosity about the historical record, a hunger for the wisdom of the elders, and a grasp of the notion of “heuristics,” these often unwritten rules of thumb that are so determining of survival. In other words, you will be forced to give weight to things that have been around, things that have survived.

Once in a while we come up with drugs that enhance performance, such as, say, steroids, only to discover what people in finance have known for a while: in a “mature” market there is no free lunch anymore, and what appears as a free lunch has a hidden risk.

there is a simple statistical reason that explains why we have not been able to find drugs that make us feel unconditionally better when we are well (or unconditionally stronger, etc.): nature would have been likely to find this magic pill by itself. But consider that illness is rare, and the more ill the person the less likely nature would have found the solution by itself, in an accelerating way.

A lesson I learned from this ancient culture is the notion of megalopsychon (a term expressed in Aristotle’s ethics), a sense of grandeur that was superseded by the Christian value of “humility.” There is no word for it in Romance languages; in Arabic it is called Shhm— best translated as nonsmall. If you take risks and face your fate with dignity, there is nothing you can do that makes you small; if you don’t take risks, there is nothing you can do that makes you grand, nothing. And when you take risks, insults by half- men (small men, those who don’t risk anything) are similar to barks by nonhuman animals: you can’t feel insulted by a dog.

The Romans removed the soldiers’ incentive to be a coward and hurt others thanks to a process called decimation. If a legion loses a battle and there is suspicion of cowardice, 10 percent of the soldiers and commanders are put to death, usually by random lottery. Decimation— meaning eliminating one in ten— has been corrupted by modern language. The magic number is one in ten (or something equivalent): putting more than 10 per cent to death would lead to weakening of the army; too little, and cowardice would be a dominant strategy.

It is a matter of commitment, or what philosophers call doxastic commitment, a type of belief- pledge that to Fat Tony and Nero needed to be translated into deeds (the reverse- Stiglitz). Doxa in Greek used to mean “belief,” but distinguished from “knowledge” (episteme); to see how it involves a commitment of sorts beyond just words, consider that in church Greek it took the meaning of glorification. Incidentally, this notion also applies to all manner of ideas and theories: the main person behind a theory, the person to be called the originator, is someone who believed in it, in a doxastic way, with a costly commitment to take it to its natural conclusion; and not necessarily the first person to mention it over dessert wine or in a footnote.

Via negativa: In theology and philosophy, the focus on what something is not, an indirect definition. In action, it is a recipe for what to avoid, what not to do— subtraction, not addition, say, in medicine.

Mediocristan: A process dominated by the mediocre, with few extreme successes or failures (say, income for a dentist). No single observation can meaningfully affect the aggregate. Also called “thin- tailed,” or member of the Gaussian family of distributions.

Extremistan: A process where the total can be conceivably impacted by a single observation (say, income for a writer). Also called “fat- tailed.” Includes the fractal, or power- law, family of distributions.
