  Every runner understands this. Front runners always work the hardest, and risk the most.

  kensho, or satori— enlightenment that comes in a flash, a blinding pop.
  Highlight (yellow) - 1962 > Page 23
  according to Zen linear thinking is nothing but a delusion, one of the many that keep us unhappy. Reality is nonlinear, Zen says. No future, no past. All is now.

  the first-century rabbi Eleazar ben Azariah said our work is the holiest part of us. All are proud of their craft. God speaks of his work; how much more should man.

  Don’t go to sleep one night, wrote Rūmī, the thirteenth-century Persian poet. What you most want will come to you then. Warmed by a sun inside you’ll see wonders.

  Robert Browning. If you get simple beauty and naught else, you get about the best thing God invents.

  Patton. Don’t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.

  A reminder to self not to hand-hold.

  happiness can be dangerous. It dulls the senses.

  in 1965, running wasn’t even a sport. It wasn’t popular, it wasn’t unpopular—it just was. To go out for a three-mile run was something weirdos did, presumably to burn off manic energy. Running for pleasure, running for exercise, running for endorphins, running to live better and longer—these things were unheard of.

  Again and again I learned that lack of equity was a leading cause of failure.
  Highlight (yellow) - 1966 > Page 90
  War is the most extreme of conditions. But business has its warlike parallels. Someone somewhere once said that business is war without bullets, and I tended to agree.

  If my life was to be all work and no play, I wanted my work to be play.

  The single easiest way to find out how you feel about someone. Say goodbye.

  Life is growth. You grow or you die.

  Confidence. More than equity, more than liquidity, that’s what a man needs.

  Johnson said, “we show up with this new Nike, and it’s totally untested, and frankly it’s not even all that good—and you guys are buying it. What gives?” The man laughed. “We’ve been doing business with you Blue Ribbon guys for years,” he said, “and we know that you guys tell the truth. Everyone else bullshits, you guys always shoot straight. So if you say this new shoe, this Nike, is worth a shot, we believe.” Johnson came back to the booth, scratching his head. “Telling the truth,” he said. “Who knew?”

  Like books, sports give people a sense of having lived other lives, of taking part in other people’s victories. And defeats. When sports are at their best, the spirit of the fan merges with the spirit of the athlete, and in that convergence, in that transference, is the oneness that the mystics talk about.

  I keep thinking of one line in The Bucket List. “You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.”

  International trade always, always benefits both trading nations.
  Highlight (yellow) - 1972 > Page 374
  “When goods don’t pass international borders, soldiers will.”

  And yet I know that this regret clashes with my secret regret—that I can’t do it all over again. God, how I wish I could relive the whole thing.
  Note - 1972 > Page 381
  I wish my life ends like this, wanting to relive it because it was so meaningful to me.

  I’d tell them to hit pause, think long and hard about how they want to spend their time, and with whom they want to spend it for the next forty years. I’d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don’t know what that means, seek it. If you’re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt.
  Highlight (yellow) - 1972 > Page 382
  I’d like to warn the best of them, the iconoclasts, the innovators, the rebels, that they will always have a bull’s-eye on their backs. The better they get, the bigger the bull’s-eye. It’s not one man’s opinion; it’s a law of nature.

  The harder you work, the better your Tao. And since no one has ever adequately defined Tao, I now try to go regularly to mass. I would tell them: Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith. Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it. Faith as faith defines itself in your heart.
