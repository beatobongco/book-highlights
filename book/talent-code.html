  <h3>Quick and dirty summary</h3>
  <p>Always struggle just outside your reach, love it and learn from it. Myelin is what makes skill. It is built in the brain and allows info to travel faster (think of it as fiber optic cables for your brain).</p>

  <p>
    Build myelin by: ignition (motivation, "I wanna be that guy!"), deep practice (mindfulness and correcting mistakes as you go), acceleration of deep practice (compressing learning e.g. training for soccer via futsal), chunking (see task as a whole, break into pieces and practice those, and varying the variables so you know things back and forth), having an intent of long term commitment, finding a master coach (teach by small targeted adjustments, understand your student and vary methods accordingly)
  </p>

  <p>
    What was especially interesting to me: the interviews + stories of real world coaches, athletes, musicians, etc that supported above concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was also a small section that debunked people who are instant geniuses (we are not born with too much pre-myelination because it is evolutionarily expensive). Geniuses aren't born, they're made in the crucible of hard work. Also, there's no age limit to myelin really.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find it comforting because it means anyone can get good at anything.
